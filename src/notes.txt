- if you get the components not loading, try using functions saved as constant variables and export instead of the normal functional components
- Error invariant failed: You should not use <Switch> outside a <Route>....solve by importing the Browserrouter in your index.js page from react router dom and place the app component inside the router tags..check guider app for reference..
- sometimes modules not found can be resolved by researching and putting a ./ in your import path.
-some bootstrap feature might not work, you might need to import bootstrap jquery css and other relevant bootsrap cdn links into the index.html page
-note that some errors might not be what you see in the error message.some might be caused by a wrong syntax or not passing a particular parameter.
- you can display data from the contect page using the syntax below:
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import {InfoConsumer} from '../Context' ;
import Info from '/Info';

 class Home extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="container">
                <div className="row mt-5">
                <InfoConsumer>
                {data=>{
                    return<h2>{data}</h2>
                    value
                }}
                </InfoConsumer>
                </div>
            </div>


         
        )
    }
}

export default Home;
